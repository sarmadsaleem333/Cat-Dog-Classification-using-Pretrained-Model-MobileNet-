# Cat vs Dog Classifier using MobileNetV2

This repository contains Python code for a cat vs dog classifier using the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Kaggle Cats and Dogs competition dataset, available at [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

The dataset contains:
- 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs (12,500 for each class) for training.
- Additional unlabeled test set for evaluation.

## Pretrained Model
The MobileNetV2 model is used as a feature extractor. It is pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the cats vs dogs dataset.

For more details about MobileNetV2, refer to the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/MobileNetV2).

## Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy:** 99.5%
- **Test Accuracy:** 97.5%

The model achieves a training accuracy of 99% and a test accuracy of 97%.
